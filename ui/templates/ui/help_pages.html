    The OSM Export Tool has three main sections; an area to create new exports (Create), an area where existing exports are stored and can be re-run (Exports), and an area where configuration files are stored and can be accessed (Store). This help page will take the user step by step through these three sections, providing information for the available functions and how to use them.
