<b>Transform Files</b>
<br><br>
Transform files are used to execute arbitrary SQL (spatialite) commands on the selected exported data.<br>
For example, create new database columns, drop existing database columns, rename columns, merge columns, or drop records.
<br>
<br>
Example 1. Insert new column into the planet_osm_point table and fill it with a copy of the "amenity" value:<br>
<br>
<i>alter table planet_osm_point add column testcolumn varchar;
update planet_osm_point set testcolumn=amenity;</i><br>
<br>
Example 2. Insert two new columns into tables building_roof_material_stone and building_roof_material_concrete, setting them to 1 if the existing column building_roof_material contains these terms:<br>
<br>
<i>alter table planet_osm_polygon add column building_roof_material_stone integer;
alter table planet_osm_polygon add column building_roof_material_concrete integer;
update planet_osm_polygon set building_roof_material_stone=1 where building_roof_material like "%stone%";
update planet_osm_polygon set building_roof_material_concrete=1 where building_roof_material like "%concrete%";</i><br>
<br>

<b>Language Files</b>
<br><br>
Language files are used to translate the contents of a database field from one language into another.<br>
For example the term "bakery" may be transformed into "boulangerie" or "road" to "jalan".
<br>
<br>

The 'Select Preset' tab provides the user with a text box to enter a 'Filename'. Once this has been completed, the user can choose to either search their desktop for the file by clicking 'Upload Preset' or  select a file from the configuration file Store by clicking ''.</p>
<p>Once the configuration file has been selected, the user will be brought back to the 'Create' wizard where they can choose to publish the file globally by clicking 'Publish File'.</p>
